# Finding Voldemort: The British Brute-Force Strategy

With cryptography, science of codes and ciphers, you can safely eliminate many useless unpronounceable combinations
Methods discussed in this chapter are:
- **consonant-vowel mapping**
	- simply maps the given word with c or v as appropriate
	- 'Riddle' becomes cvcccv
- trigram frequency
	- most frequent trigrams in English are 'the', 'and', 'ing'
	- most infrequent 'zvq'
- digram frequency
	- commonly occuring digrams are 'st', 'an', 'er'
	- less commonly occuring are 'kg', 'vl', 'oq'
