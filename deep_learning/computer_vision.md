# Computer Vision
It is the process of training a computer to do operation like image classification, or image segmentation on image datasets

- The nerual networks that are best at this task is called convolutional neural network CNN for short
- In CNN, there are two main componenets base and head
- Base extracts featues from the image and head classfies the processed features from the base 

The goal of the network during training is to learn two things:
- which features to extract from an image (base).
- which class goes with what features (head).

Using a pretrained base model with an untrained head is called *transfer learning*
