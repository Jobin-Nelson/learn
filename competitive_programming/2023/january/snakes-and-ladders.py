Qn: You are given an n x n integer matrix board where the cells are labeled
    from 1 to n2 in a Boustrophedon style starting from the bottom left of the
    board (i.e. board[n - 1][0]) and alternating direction each row.

    You start on square 1 of the board. In each move, starting from square
    curr, do the following:

    - Choose a destination square next with a label in the range [curr + 1, 
    min(curr + 6, n2)]. This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die
    roll: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of
    the board. 
    - If next has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of
    that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to next. 
    - The game ends when you reach the square nÂ² 

    A board square on row r and column c has a snake or ladder if board[r][c]
    != -1. The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c]. Squares 1
    and n2 do not have a snake or ladder.

    Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the
    destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder,
    you do not follow the subsequent snake or ladder.

    For example, suppose the board is [[-1,4],[-1,3]], and on the first move,
    your destination square is 2. You follow the ladder to square 3, but do not
    follow the subsequent ladder to 4. Return the least number of moves
    required to reach the square n2. If it is not possible to reach the square,
    return -1.

Notes:
    - use directed graph and bfs
    - edges are 1-6 representing the numbers on dice and add more for ladders
      and snakes
