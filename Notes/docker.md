# Docker
- Docker helps with building, running and deploying applications on any machine running docker
- Docker achieves this with the help of containers which is an isolated environment

# Container vs Virtual Machine
## Container
- An isolated environment for running an application
- Sits on top of the OS
- Lightweight, needs less hardware resources

## Virtual Machine
- It acts like a seperate whole machine with an OS of your choice
- Sits on top of the hardware 
- Heavy and resource intensive
